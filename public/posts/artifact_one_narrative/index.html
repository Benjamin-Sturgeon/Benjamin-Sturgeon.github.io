Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?


The Weight Tracking Application is a mobile-based solution designed to
help users track their weight progress effectively while integrating
notifications and user-friendly UI enhancements. Originally developed
as part of my coursework, the artifact combines data storage,
interactive UI elements, and real-time notifications to encourage
weight management. The initial version contained foundational
functionality but lacked modern aesthetics, efficient UI behavior, and
seamless account management features.">

        <p>Artifact One Narrative</p>
<ol>
<li>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The Weight Tracking Application is a mobile-based solution designed to
help users track their weight progress effectively while integrating
notifications and user-friendly UI enhancements. Originally developed
as part of my coursework, the artifact combines data storage,
interactive UI elements, and real-time notifications to encourage
weight management. The initial version contained foundational
functionality but lacked modern aesthetics, efficient UI behavior, and
seamless account management features.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did
you select this item? What specific components of the artifact
showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was
the artifact improved?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This artifact showcases my ability to design, implement, and refine a
fully functional mobile application with full-stack principles. I
selected it because it highlights my software development expertise,
including:</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>UI/UX Design and Refinement</strong> - Using Material Design principles to
enhance usability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Documentation and Readability</strong> – Writing code which is easy
to understand and well commented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Database Management and Account Handling</strong> - Securely storing and
processing user data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Event-Based Notifications</strong> - Implementing SMS and popup alerts for
user achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Considerations</strong> - Adding error handling and safe account
deletion mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The improvement process focused on modernizing UI components,
enhancing database functions, and refining user interactions, making
it a standout example of my ability to integrate design and
functionality.</p>
<p>Several key improvements were made to transform the application:</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>UI Modernization</strong> - Redesigned login and tracking pages,
including rounded corners, gradient backgrounds, refined typography,
and smoother animations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Functionality</strong> - Introduced floating action buttons
(FAB), structured RecyclerView elements, and a streamlined toolbar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account Management Features</strong> - Developed a secure Delete Account
function, ensuring proper database cleanup before user removal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Notification System</strong> - Added SMS and popup alerts for
reaching weight goals, enhancing user motivation and engagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Enhancements</strong> - Strengthened error handling, null
checks, and defensive programming techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Code Readability and Documentation</strong> – Introduced helper
functions instead of repeated code in methods and implement thorough
commentary on all lines of code for understandability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>These updates make the artifact visually appealing, functionally
robust, and highly user-friendly.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this
enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your
outcome-coverage plans?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This enhancement process aligns with multiple course outcomes:</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collaborative Environment Building - Structured clear decision-making
logic and intuitive UX design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional Communication in Software Development - Delivered clean
and maintainable code with structured documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computing Solutions Evaluation - Applied algorithmic principles and
well-designed data management techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software Engineering Techniques - Implemented industry-standard
database integration and UI components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security Mindset Development - Strengthened privacy safeguards and
prevented unauthorized database operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>With these improvements, the project meets all intended course
outcomes, reinforcing my ability to design and refine industry-ready
applications.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What
did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What
challenges did you face?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The enhancement process was both challenging and rewarding. I refined
UI structures by implementing Material Design best practices. That
process went fairly smoothly, however after that I faced challenges
with database management, especially ensuring safe account deletion
and cleanup. Fortunately, I was able to determine the best way to
implement the missing CRUD functionality with both the user and
weights databases. The SMS and popup notification integration required
careful handling to ensure seamless user experience. As I implemented
the additional popup notifications, I noticed some errors in the
functionality for the SMS notifications. One such error was that the
application did not provide a congratulatory message if a weight that
was already present in the list was edited to a value that met or was
under the goal weight. I was able to correct this oversight thanks to
my work on other improvements. Debugging UI layout issues involved
troubleshooting constraint problems while maintaining a responsive
design. Changing the layout of my xml files to be more pleasant to
view proved slightly challenging due to the nature of a constraint
layout. I had to be careful that every button and item fit
proportionally on the screen, which took some trial and error. I was
able to produce a significant UI improvement that matched the intended
functionality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this project strengthened my problem-solving skills,
reinforced software engineering principles, and showcased my ability
to develop modern mobile applications.</p></blockquote>
