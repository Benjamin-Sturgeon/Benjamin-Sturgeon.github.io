What is the identification and description of each technology?</strong><br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field dedicated to enabling machines
to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as
perception, learning, reasoning, and language comprehension. It includes
technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and
computer vision. AI has evolved rapidly in recent years through
advancements in large language models and real-time data analytics.
Cloud computing, in contrast, provides on-demand access to computing
resources such as servers, storage, and applications via the internet.
This model frees developers from the limitations of physical
infrastructure by allowing rapid deployment, scalable performance, and
seamless global collaboration. Both AI and cloud computing are more than
just innovations; they are fundamental shifts in how modern computing
systems are designed and operated.</p><p><strong>2. What are the likely impacts on computer science or your career?</strong><br>AI and cloud computing are closely tied to the future direction of
computer science, and they have a significant influence on my career. In
my work with authentication systems, I already see how AI contributes to
real-time threat detection, behavioral pattern recognition, and smart
user feedback loops. It also supports intelligent debugging tools that
make the troubleshooting process faster and more precise. Cloud
computing has redefined how I deploy and manage secure, scalable
services. Whether it involves implementing JWT-based authentication,
addressing CORS issues between Angular and Express, or optimizing
distributed databases, cloud infrastructure allows for greater
flexibility and maintainability. These technologies help me spend less
time on infrastructure management and more time on system refinement and
innovation. I hope to further my learning by working on open source
projects that utilize AWS.</p><p><strong>3. How might the two technologies impact humans, communities, or the
world?</strong><br>AI and cloud computing are not only transforming technical workflows but
also reshaping the lives of individuals and communities across the
globe. AI is being used to enhance healthcare diagnostics, support
inclusive technologies for people with disabilities, tailor educational
experiences, and even anticipate environmental risks. However, it also
raises critical concerns about bias, accountability, and data privacy
that need to be addressed responsibly. Cloud computing helps bridge
digital divides by enabling access to powerful computing tools
regardless of geography or financial status. It empowers small
businesses, connects isolated communities, and accelerates response
times in disaster recovery efforts. At the same time, this widespread
adoption requires us to consider issues like environmental
sustainability, equitable access, and ethical data governance.</p><p><strong>4. Which course outcomes have you achieved so far, and which ones
remain?</strong><br>I have successfully deepened my understanding of how emerging
technologies like AI and cloud computing are reshaping computer science,
and I have applied this knowledge to real-world scenarios involving
system architecture and digital security. I have also taken time to
reflect on the broader societal and ethical dimensions of these
developments, which has helped me become more intentional in my approach
to software design. Looking ahead, I am working toward greater fluency
in integrating modern APIs into complex systems and expanding my ability
to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that bring together AI,
security, and user experience. As I continue to refine web applications
with strong feedback and authentication mechanisms, I am focused on
developing solutions that are not only technically sound but also
responsive to human needs. So far, having completed my improvements on
all of the three artifacts, all course outcomes have been achieved.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Roman, D. (2024, August 26). <em>The impact of AI on Computer Science
