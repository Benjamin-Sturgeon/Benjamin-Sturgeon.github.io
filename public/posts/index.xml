&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. What is the identification and description of each technology?&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field dedicated to enabling machines
to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as
perception, learning, reasoning, and language comprehension. It includes
technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and
computer vision. AI has evolved rapidly in recent years through
advancements in large language models and real-time data analytics.
Cloud computing, in contrast, provides on-demand access to computing
resources such as servers, storage, and applications via the internet.
This model frees developers from the limitations of physical
infrastructure by allowing rapid deployment, scalable performance, and
seamless global collaboration. Both AI and cloud computing are more than
just innovations; they are fundamental shifts in how modern computing
systems are designed and operated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artifact Three Narrative</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_three_narrative/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 20:10:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_three_narrative/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artifact Three Narrative&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Travlr Authentication System Enhancement and Debugging&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Artifact Overview&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The artifact that I have chosen for this category is my full-stack
development website utilizing the MEAN stack. This application is
derived from my CS-465 Full-Stack Development 1 class. I have chosen
this artifact because it provides me with a great framework to showcase
my ability to improve a full-stack application. I specifically planned
to implement Authorization security procedures for users which access
the Mongo Database in this application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal Three</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/journalthree/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 14:31:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/journalthree/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part One:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Journal Entry: Emerging Trends in Computer Science&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. What is the significance of each trend?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
AI in cybersecurity is revolutionizing threat detection by automating
security analysis, predicting potential vulnerabilities, and responding
to attacks in real time. With the rise of sophisticated cyber threats,
AI-driven security systems play a vital role in safeguarding sensitive
data and ensuring operational continuity across industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Blockchain for Secure Data Management&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Blockchain technology is transforming secure data handling by
introducing decentralized, tamper-proof ledgers that enhance
transparency and eliminate third-party dependencies. This approach
ensures that data remains verifiable and resilient to unauthorized
modifications, reinforcing trust in digital transactions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal Two</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/journaltwo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 14:31:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/journaltwo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part One:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Have you changed your career plans? If so, what prompted this
change? If not, why have you remained with your original plan?&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Yes, Iâ€™ve shifted my career plans from data science to full-stack
development and application development. This change was driven by
my growing interest in user-centric design, structured workflows,
and maintainability. Through hands-on coding and collaborative
projects, I realized that I enjoy building complete systems that
prioritize efficiency and adaptability, rather than purely analyzing
data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Code Review</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/codereview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:31:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/codereview/</guid><description>&lt;p>I completed a code review prior to implementing improvements to the projects. The link to this code review is provided here:
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ULIRyS-XVs4" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/ULIRyS-XVs4&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the Script for the code review. It addresses improvmenent for three seperate projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code Review Script&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Category One: Software Design and Engineering&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provide a clear, complete description of existing code
&lt;strong>functionality&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>What does the code do?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The first artifact that I will be improving is a Weight
Tracking Application. This simple Java application is
designed to run on Android OS and provides users with a
way to track their weight. They can also set their goal
weight and opt in to receive a text notification once
their goal weight is reached. User accounts are created
during the initial login screen of the application. Data
is kept locally on the device via a MongoDB schema.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Focus on the features and functions of the existing code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal One</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/journalone/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:31:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/journalone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part One:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How might you use an ePortfolio for the benefit of self-promotion?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>An ePortfolio provides me with an excellent place to provide potential
employers with a showcase of my previous work and skills. It also
provides my contact information and other resume details in pleasant
format with an interactable UI. This showcases my ability to go above
and beyond in my application presentation which will potentially give me
a leg up over other candidates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artifact One Narrative</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_one_narrative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:10:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_one_narrative/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artifact One Narrative&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Weight Tracking Application is a mobile-based solution designed to
help users track their weight progress effectively while integrating
notifications and user-friendly UI enhancements. Originally developed
as part of my coursework, the artifact combines data storage,
interactive UI elements, and real-time notifications to encourage
weight management. The initial version contained foundational
functionality but lacked modern aesthetics, efficient UI behavior, and
seamless account management features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artifact Two Narrative</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_two_narrative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:10:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_two_narrative/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artifact Two Narrative&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Narrative: Enhancing the AAC Grazioso Salvare Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Brief Description of the Artifact&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This artifact is an interactive Jupyter Dash application, built to
visualize animal rescue data efficiently using MongoDB queries, Dash
components, and Plotly visualizations. Originally created as part of the
Southern New Hampshire University CS 499 Capstone, the dashboard
provides users with filtering options, an interactive data table, a map
visualization, and a pie chart representation of rescued animal breeds.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
