&lt;p>Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program at
Southern New Hampshire University, I’ve developed robust technical
skills while shaping a problem-solving mindset that prioritizes clarity,
security, and user-centric design. Completing this program and curating
my ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on my growth across full-stack
development, authentication security, data visualization, mobile UX
enhancement and most importantly, to frame those accomplishments in a
way that’s ready for industry impact.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Databases</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/databases/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 20:19:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/databases/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the third improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The artifact that I have chosen for this category is my full-stack
development website utilizing the MEAN stack. This application is
derived from my CS-465 Full-Stack Development 1 class. I have chosen
this artifact because it provides me with a great framework to showcase
my ability to improve a full-stack application. I specifically planned
to implement Authorization security procedures for users which access
the Mongo Database in this application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artifact Three Narrative</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_three_narrative/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 20:10:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_three_narrative/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artifact Three Narrative&lt;/p>

The link to this code review is provided here:
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ULIRyS-XVs4" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/ULIRyS-XVs4&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the Script for the code review. It addresses improvmenent for three seperate projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code Review Script&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Category One: Software Design and Engineering&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provide a clear, complete description of existing code
&lt;strong>functionality&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>What does the code do?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The first artifact that I will be improving is a Weight
Tracking Application. This simple Java application is
designed to run on Android OS and provides users with a
way to track their weight. They can also set their goal
weight and opt in to receive a text notification once
their goal weight is reached. User accounts are created
during the initial login screen of the application. Data
is kept locally on the device via a MongoDB schema.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Focus on the features and functions of the existing code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Algorithms and Data Structures</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/algorithmsanddatastructures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:19:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/algorithmsanddatastructures/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the second improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have chosen to improve the code for the animal shelters application which utilizes python in order to perform CRUD operations as well as search and filters on content within a database. This application was developed in my CS-340 Client/Server Development class. This provides an excellent framework to implement improved code structure, improved portability of code methods, and enhanced optimization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Engineering And Design</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/softwareengineeringanddesign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:19:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/softwareengineeringanddesign/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The artifact that I have chosen for this category is my Weight Tracking application that I developed in my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming class. I have chosen this because it provides an excellent opportunity to showcase my understanding of application development and how to make changes based on the visual needs of users.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artifact One Narrative</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_one_narrative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:10:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_one_narrative/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Artifact One: Weight Tracking Application&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Weight Tracking Application&lt;/em> is a mobile-based Android solution designed to assist users in monitoring their weight progress through interactive features, intuitive design, and goal-driven notifications. Created as part of my coursework in 2025, the initial version implemented basic logging and visualization capabilities. Enhancements brought refined user interface elements, responsive layouts, and meaningful real-time engagement, transforming the app into a more complete, user-centric experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artifact Two Narrative</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_two_narrative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:10:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_two_narrative/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artifact Two Narrative&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Narrative: Enhancing the AAC Grazioso Salvare Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Brief Description of the Artifact&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This artifact is an interactive Jupyter Dash application, built to visualize animal rescue data efficiently using MongoDB queries, Dash components, and Plotly visualizations. Originally created as part of the Southern New Hampshire University CS 499 Capstone, the dashboard provides users with filtering options, an interactive data table, a map visualization, and a pie chart representation of rescued animal breeds.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/about/about_me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 18:33:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/about/about_me/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/images/avatar2.jpg" alt="Benjamin Stureon">&lt;/p>
