&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. What is the identification and description of each technology?&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field dedicated to enabling machines
to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as
perception, learning, reasoning, and language comprehension. It includes
technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and
computer vision. AI has evolved rapidly in recent years through
advancements in large language models and real-time data analytics.
Cloud computing, in contrast, provides on-demand access to computing
resources such as servers, storage, and applications via the internet.
This model frees developers from the limitations of physical
infrastructure by allowing rapid deployment, scalable performance, and
seamless global collaboration. Both AI and cloud computing are more than
just innovations; they are fundamental shifts in how modern computing
systems are designed and operated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Databases</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/databases/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 20:19:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/databases/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the third improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Have you changed your career plans? If so, what prompted this
change? If not, why have you remained with your original plan?&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Yes, I’ve shifted my career plans from data science to full-stack
development and application development. This change was driven by
my growing interest in user-centric design, structured workflows,
and maintainability. Through hands-on coding and collaborative
projects, I realized that I enjoy building complete systems that
prioritize efficiency and adaptability, rather than purely analyzing
data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/contact/contact/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:39:10 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/contact/contact/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="contact-information">

The link to this code review is provided here:
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ULIRyS-XVs4" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/ULIRyS-XVs4&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the Script for the code review. It addresses improvmenent for three seperate projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code Review Script&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Category One: Software Design and Engineering&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provide a clear, complete description of existing code
&lt;strong>functionality&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>What does the code do?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The first artifact that I will be improving is a Weight
Tracking Application. This simple Java application is
designed to run on Android OS and provides users with a
way to track their weight. They can also set their goal
weight and opt in to receive a text notification once
their goal weight is reached. User accounts are created
during the initial login screen of the application. Data
is kept locally on the device via a MongoDB schema.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Focus on the features and functions of the existing code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal One</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/journalone/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:31:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/journalone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part One:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How might you use an ePortfolio for the benefit of self-promotion?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>An ePortfolio provides me with an excellent place to provide potential
employers with a showcase of my previous work and skills. It also
provides my contact information and other resume details in pleasant
format with an interactable UI. This showcases my ability to go above
and beyond in my application presentation which will potentially give me
a leg up over other candidates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Algorithms and Data Structures</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/algorithmsanddatastructures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:19:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/algorithmsanddatastructures/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the second improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have chosen to improve the code for the animal shelters application which utilizes python in order to perform CRUD operations as well as search and filters on content within a database. This application was developed in my CS-340 Client/Server Development class. This provides an excellent framework to implement improved code structure, improved portability of code methods, and enhanced optimization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Engineering And Design</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/softwareengineeringanddesign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:19:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/softwareengineeringanddesign/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The artifact that I have chosen for this category is my Weight Tracking application that I developed in my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming class. I have chosen this because it provides an excellent opportunity to showcase my understanding of application development and how to make changes based on the visual needs of users.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artifact One Narrative</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_one_narrative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:10:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_one_narrative/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artifact One Narrative&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Weight Tracking Application is a mobile-based solution designed to
help users track their weight progress effectively while integrating
notifications and user-friendly UI enhancements. Originally developed
as part of my coursework, the artifact combines data storage,
interactive UI elements, and real-time notifications to encourage
weight management. The initial version contained foundational
functionality but lacked modern aesthetics, efficient UI behavior, and
seamless account management features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artifact Two Narrative</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_two_narrative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:10:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/posts/artifact_two_narrative/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artifact Two Narrative&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Narrative: Enhancing the AAC Grazioso Salvare Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Brief Description of the Artifact&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This artifact is an interactive Jupyter Dash application, built to
