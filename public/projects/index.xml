&lt;p>The artifact that I have chosen for this category is my full-stack
development website utilizing the MEAN stack. This application is
derived from my CS-465 Full-Stack Development 1 class. I have chosen
this artifact because it provides me with a great framework to showcase
my ability to improve a full-stack application. I specifically planned
to implement Authorization security procedures for users which access
the Mongo Database in this application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Algorithms and Data Structures</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/algorithmsanddatastructures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:19:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/algorithmsanddatastructures/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the second improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have chosen to improve the code for the animal shelters application which utilizes python in order to perform CRUD operations as well as search and filters on content within a database. This application was developed in my CS-340 Client/Server Development class. This provides an excellent framework to implement improved code structure, improved portability of code methods, and enhanced optimization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Engineering And Design</title><link>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/softwareengineeringanddesign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 20:19:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://benjamin-sturgeon.github.io/projects/softwareengineeringanddesign/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The artifact that I have chosen for this category is my Weight Tracking application that I developed in my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming class. I have chosen this because it provides an excellent opportunity to showcase my understanding of application development and how to make changes based on the visual needs of users.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
