      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to improve the code for the animal shelters application which utilizes python in order to perform CRUD operations as well as search and filters on content within a database. This application was developed in my CS-340 Client/Server Development class. This provides an excellent framework to implement improved code structure, improved portability of code methods, and enhanced optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first improvement project that I have chosen to showcase as part of my Computer Scence Capstone Class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The artifact that I have chosen for this category is my Weight Tracking application that I developed in my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming class. I have chosen this because it provides an excellent opportunity to showcase my understanding of application development and how to make changes based on the visual needs of users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
