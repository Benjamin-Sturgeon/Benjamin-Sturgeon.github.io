Artifact One Narrative

1.  Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

> The Weight Tracking Application is a mobile-based solution designed to
> help users track their weight progress effectively while integrating
> notifications and user-friendly UI enhancements. Originally developed
> as part of my coursework, the artifact combines data storage,
> interactive UI elements, and real-time notifications to encourage
> weight management. The initial version contained foundational
> functionality but lacked modern aesthetics, efficient UI behavior, and
> seamless account management features.

1.  Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did
    you select this item? What specific components of the artifact
    showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was
    the artifact improved?

> This artifact showcases my ability to design, implement, and refine a
> fully functional mobile application with full-stack principles. I
> selected it because it highlights my software development expertise,
> including:

- **UI/UX Design and Refinement** - Using Material Design principles to
  enhance usability.

- **Design Documentation and Readability** – Writing code which is easy
  to understand and well commented.

- **Database Management and Account Handling** - Securely storing and
  processing user data.

- **Event-Based Notifications** - Implementing SMS and popup alerts for
  user achievements.

- **Security Considerations** - Adding error handling and safe account
  deletion mechanisms.

> The improvement process focused on modernizing UI components,
> enhancing database functions, and refining user interactions, making
> it a standout example of my ability to integrate design and
> functionality.
>
> Several key improvements were made to transform the application:

1.  **UI Modernization** - Redesigned login and tracking pages,
    including rounded corners, gradient backgrounds, refined typography,
    and smoother animations.

2.  **Enhanced Functionality** - Introduced floating action buttons
    (FAB), structured RecyclerView elements, and a streamlined toolbar.

3.  **Account Management Features** - Developed a secure Delete Account
    function, ensuring proper database cleanup before user removal.

4.  **Improved Notification System** - Added SMS and popup alerts for
    reaching weight goals, enhancing user motivation and engagement.

5.  **Security Enhancements** - Strengthened error handling, null
    checks, and defensive programming techniques.

6.  **Improved Code Readability and Documentation** – Introduced helper
    functions instead of repeated code in methods and implement thorough
    commentary on all lines of code for understandability.

> These updates make the artifact visually appealing, functionally
> robust, and highly user-friendly.

1.  Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this
    enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your
    outcome-coverage plans?

> This enhancement process aligns with multiple course outcomes:

- Collaborative Environment Building - Structured clear decision-making
  logic and intuitive UX design.

- Professional Communication in Software Development - Delivered clean
  and maintainable code with structured documentation.

- Computing Solutions Evaluation - Applied algorithmic principles and
  well-designed data management techniques.

- Software Engineering Techniques - Implemented industry-standard
  database integration and UI components.

- Security Mindset Development - Strengthened privacy safeguards and
  prevented unauthorized database operations.

> With these improvements, the project meets all intended course
> outcomes, reinforcing my ability to design and refine industry-ready
> applications.

1.  Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What
    did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What
    challenges did you face?

> The enhancement process was both challenging and rewarding. I refined
> UI structures by implementing Material Design best practices. That
> process went fairly smoothly, however after that I faced challenges
> with database management, especially ensuring safe account deletion
> and cleanup. Fortunately, I was able to determine the best way to
> implement the missing CRUD functionality with both the user and
> weights databases. The SMS and popup notification integration required
> careful handling to ensure seamless user experience. As I implemented
> the additional popup notifications, I noticed some errors in the
> functionality for the SMS notifications. One such error was that the
> application did not provide a congratulatory message if a weight that
> was already present in the list was edited to a value that met or was
> under the goal weight. I was able to correct this oversight thanks to
> my work on other improvements. Debugging UI layout issues involved
> troubleshooting constraint problems while maintaining a responsive
> design. Changing the layout of my xml files to be more pleasant to
> view proved slightly challenging due to the nature of a constraint
> layout. I had to be careful that every button and item fit
> proportionally on the screen, which took some trial and error. I was
> able to produce a significant UI improvement that matched the intended
> functionality.
>
> Ultimately, this project strengthened my problem-solving skills,
> reinforced software engineering principles, and showcased my ability
> to develop modern mobile applications.
