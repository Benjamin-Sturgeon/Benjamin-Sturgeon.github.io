Part One:

1.  How might you use an ePortfolio for the benefit of self-promotion?

An ePortfolio provides me with an excellent place to provide potential
employers with a showcase of my previous work and skills. It also
provides my contact information and other resume details in pleasant
format with an interactable UI. This showcases my ability to go above
and beyond in my application presentation which will potentially give me
a leg up over other candidates.

1.  How might you mitigate risks while maximizing the marketing
    potential of the ePortfolio?

The primary risk that I read about in our resources was that an
ePortfolio has the risk of creating a public point of access to a
developer’s work. This has the risk of other developers stealing
intellectual property that is unique to the developer who created that
code. I mitigate this by limiting the scope of the projects on the
portfolio, Instead, I highlight the main points of the project and
provide visual access without access to the full code base. This helps
mitigate the risk of my intellectual property being stolen, however at
my current level of experience in all honestly this is highly unlikely
in the first place.

1.  Describe possible downsides or risks—for instance, the risks of
    posting intellectual property online for public consumption.

One downside that was mentioned is that if I present too much
information in my portfolio, it can cause the potential employer to be
overwhelmed and move on to a candidate with a more concise presentation.
Also, as previously mentioned, the intellectual property of my projects
could be stolen by developers or other malicious individuals who access
my website. There is also technically a small risk of malicious actions
on the portfolio website itself, however I expect this is unlikely to
occur as my projects are not confidential in nature.

1.  Which course outcomes have you achieved so far, and which ones
    remain?

So far I have made progress on outcomes two and three due to my
implementation and improvement of my code structure and
documentation/commentary.

Part Two:

Provide an update to your instructor on your progress with each category
of artifacts for the ePortfolio:
