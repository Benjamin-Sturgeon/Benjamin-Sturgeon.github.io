Part One:

1.  **Have you changed your career plans? If so, what prompted this
    change? If not, why have you remained with your original plan?**  
    Yes, I’ve shifted my career plans from data science to full-stack
    development and application development. This change was driven by
    my growing interest in user-centric design, structured workflows,
    and maintainability. Through hands-on coding and collaborative
    projects, I realized that I enjoy building complete systems that
    prioritize efficiency and adaptability, rather than purely analyzing
    data.

2.  **How has your thinking about your career evolved?**  
    Initially, I was drawn to data science for its analytical depth, but
    my experiences working on development projects helped me see the
    broader picture of software architecture and user interaction. I now
    value iterative development, system design, and the ability to shape
    applications that directly impact users. This shift aligns better
    with my strengths in structured problem-solving, collaboration, and
    leveraging diverse skill sets within a team.

3.  **Have you completed any research about your choice of career? How
    has this impacted your thinking? Have you thought about seeking an
    advanced degree or certification after earning your undergraduate
    degree?**  
    Yes, I’ve actively researched full-stack development and application
    engineering, focusing on best practices in system architecture,
    collaborative workflows, and user-centric design. This research has
    reinforced my interest in building scalable, maintainable
    applications that prioritize efficiency and adaptability.

Beyond research, I’ve also worked on revising my resume to better
reflect my skills and experience, ensuring it aligns with industry
expectations. I’ve applied to several jobs, refining my understanding of
employer expectations and current market demands. Additionally, I’ve
been practicing on LeetCode to strengthen my problem-solving and coding
skills, preparing for technical interviews. This highlighted a major
area of improvement for me in the realm of logic work. The work on
actual projects is very different from the simple in concept but
difficult in practice logic challenges.

As for certifications, I’m considering industry credentials such as AWS,
Google Cloud, and advanced React/Node.js training to further solidify my
expertise. While I haven’t made a final decision on pursuing an advanced
degree, I’m open to specialized programs in system architecture or
cybersecurity to deepen my knowledge in key areas. I ultimately would
have to do my masters at the same time as working in the field if I
chose to pursue further education simply for financial reasons.

1.  **Which course outcomes have you achieved so far, and which ones
    remain?**  
    I’ve successfully strengthened my ability to visualize project
    architecture through system diagrams and flows (Outcome \#3), and
    I’ve improved my sprint-based development and progress tracking
    (Outcome \#4). Additionally, I’ve effectively applied strategies for
    fostering collaboration within team-based environments (Outcome \#1)
    to enhance project success.

> As I continue progressing, I plan to refine my technical communication
> skills (Outcome \#2), ensuring that my written and visual
> presentations are precise and audience specific. Additionally,
> developing a more robust security mindset (Outcome \#5) is something I
> aim to improve, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and optimizing
> system security in my projects.
